Pandas :

it is a data processing library...
pan da --> panel data = panda

It is a Python library used for working with datasets from different Sources/ Databases.

It has functiions for analyzing, cleaning, exploring, and manipulating data.

Pandas can clean messy data sets, 
and make them readable and relevant.

Relevant data is very important in data science.


Advantages :

1. Fast and efficient for manipulating and analyzing data.
2. Data from different files objects can be loaded.
3. Easy handling of missing data (represented as NaN).


Two data types :

1. Series data type:
A Pandas series is like a column in a table.
It is a one-dimensional array holding data of any type.

2. DataFrame data type:
Data sets in Pandas are ususally multi-dimensional tables, 
2 dimensional = rows & columns
Series is like a column, a DataFrame is the whole table.


import pandas as pd
lis = [1,7,2]
seri = pd.Series(lis)
print(seri)


import pandas

mydataset = {
    'name':["ram","shyam","sita"],
    'age':[3,7,2]
}

# example ---->
myvar = pandas.DataFrame(mydataset)
print(myvar)


import pandas
mydataset = {
    'name':["ram","shyam","sita"],
    'age':[3,7,2],
    'city':['Maha','Bang','Hyd']
}

# example ---->
myvar = pandas.DataFrame(mydataset)
print(myvar)
